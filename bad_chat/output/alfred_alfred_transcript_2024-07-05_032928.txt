User: Initial Prompt
Model: pitch me a movie that you think would be a critical hit. think as far inside or outside the box as you like.

User: Sure! Here is a pitch for a movie I believe would be a critical hit:

"A man wakes up one morning to find he has lost his ability to remember anything new. As time goes on, he realizes this condition isn't just affecting him but everyone else in the world as well. In a race against time and memory loss, he must uncover what is causing this mysterious global phenomenon before all knowledge is lost forever."

This movie would be a critical hit because it touches on several relevant themes such as the fragility of human memory, the importance of knowledge, and the dangers of information loss in an increasingly digital world. The plot itself is also very intriguing and suspenseful, keeping viewers on the edge of their seats from start to finish.
Model: I would definitely go see this movie! It sounds like it has a compelling storyline that will keep audiences engaged throughout. I also appreciate how you touched upon relevant themes within our society today which makes this film more thought-provoking and impactful for viewers

User: I'm glad you like it! What is the name of your main character
Model: The protagonist of my story is named "Luna." She is an aspiring writer who lives in London and works as a barista at a local coffee shop.

She is passionate about literature, poetry, and art, and she loves to attend gallery openings, book readings, and concerts in her free time. She also enjoys traveling and exploring new places, often taking solo road trips or backpacking adventures across Europe.

Luna has a close-knit group of friends who share her interests and support her creative pursuits. They are an eclectic mix of artists, musicians, writers, and dreamers who provide a constant source of inspiration and encouragement for Luna.

Despite the challenges she faces in pursuing her dreams and making ends meet in a big city like London, Luna remains optimistic and determined to succeed as a writer and find happiness in life through the power of art and storytelling.
