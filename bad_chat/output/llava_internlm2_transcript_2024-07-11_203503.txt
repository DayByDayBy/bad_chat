User: Error during generation: model 'llava' not found, try pulling it first
Model: It seems that you encountered an error while trying to generate something related to the `llava` model. This issue typically arises because your environment doesn't have access to this particular model.

To resolve this problem, follow these steps:

1. **Check Availability of 'llava' Model**: Ensure that the repository or source where you are attempting to pull the `llava` model from is correctly specified and up-to-date.
   
2. **Pull the Required Model**:
   Depending on your platform (Python environment), there might be specific commands for pulling models.

In a typical Python setup, if it's a custom model developed by someone in your organization or team, you may need to pull this locally using something like `!wget` and then load it into your script. For instance:

```
!wget <url_of_the_model>
import llama
llama.model = 'URL_OF_THE_MODEL'
```

If the model is from a specific library or service (like OpenAI's GPT), you'll typically use their API to fetch the needed version of the model.

3. **Verify Installation**:
   Ensure that all necessary libraries and dependencies for `llava` are installed correctly in your environment.
   
4. **Restart Your Environment**: Sometimes, a simple restart can resolve issues related to outdated or cached states.

If you're still facing difficulties after following these steps, please provide more context about what exactly the model is supposed to do so I can assist further!
